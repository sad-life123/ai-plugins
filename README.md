/chat/ - useless unchecked
basic embedded chat into courses..... 

/quizgen/ - useless unchecked
basic question generator based on IDK ...

/textprocessor/ - atleast it loads, must be updated, ollama connection failed on local machine.
must generate something edited based on (word,pdf ideally). Something edited includes bald text, sizes, etc... (fixed in 1 prompt edit yeah)

next fixes:
- functionality of all 3
- retarded ai ui.
- (?) extension of basic ai core gui, not a new one for each plugin.
- some request-based additions.
